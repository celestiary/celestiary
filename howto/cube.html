<h1>A Simple Cube</h1>
To start with, a simple scene is defined with an object and
controls.  Try rotating the cube with your mouse.  A scroll up or
down gesture or mouse-wheel will zoom.  Double-button drag will
pan.

<script type="module">
  // First import from third-party libraries.  This syntax picks only
  // the named items, AmbientLight and PointLight, from the many
  // exported from three.module.js.
  import {AmbientLight, PointLight} from './js/lib/three.js/three.module.js';

  // Next, import classes from this project.
  import ThreeUi from './js/three_ui.js';
  import Fullscreen from './js/fullscreen.js';

  // Lastly, you can also grab all items defined in a module and put
  // them under a local name like 'Shapes'.
  import * as Shapes from './js/shapes.js';


  // Bind the ThreeUi to the "ui" HTML page element.
  const ui = new ThreeUi('ui');

  // Pull the camera back from center 10 units along the z-axis
  // (towards the viewer).
  ui.camera.position.set(1, 2, 3);

  // Create a light and move away 10 units from the center along
  // each axis to give // interesting lighting.
  const light = new PointLight();
  light.position.set(3, 4, 5);
  ui.scene.add(light);

  // Add a unit cube at the center; (0,0,0) is implicit.
  ui.scene.add(Shapes.cube());
