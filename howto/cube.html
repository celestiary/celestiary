<h1>A Simple Cube</h1>
To start with, a simple scene is defined with an object and
controls.  Try rotating the cube with your mouse.  A scroll up or
down gesture or mouse-wheel will zoom.  Double-button drag will
pan.

<script type="module">
  // Import things from libraries, showing three types of syntax.
  // First syntax imports a single thing that three_ui.js exports, so
  // just need to give it a name.
  import ThreeUi from './js/three_ui.js';
  import Fullscreen from './js/fullscreen.js';

  // Second syntax picks one thing from the many exported from
  // three.module.js.
  import {AmbientLight, PointLight} from './js/lib/three.js/three.module.js';

  // Last syntax grabs everything from shapes and puts them under
  // the name 'Shapes' so they're easily accessible here.
  import * as Shapes from './js/shapes.js';

  // Bind the ThreeUi to the "ui" HTML page element.
  const ui = new ThreeUi('ui');

  // Pull the camera back from center 10 units along the z-axis
  // (towards the viewer).
  ui.camera.position.z = 10;

  // Create a light and move away 10 units from the center along
  // each axis to give // interesting lighting.
  const light = new PointLight();
  light.position.set(10, 10, 10);
  ui.scene.add(light);
  ui.scene.add(new AmbientLight(0x404040));

  // Add a unit cube at the center; (0,0,0) is implicit.
  ui.scene.add(Shapes.cube());
